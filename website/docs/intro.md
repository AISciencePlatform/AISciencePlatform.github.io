# Introduction

In this work we present our first iteration of the AI Science Platform (AISP) we envision. In this prototype, this platform has several novel elements regarding hardware and software. We also developed a matching digital twin which we make openly available. As a proof-of-concept we perform experiments under teleoperation, namely peg transfer, gauze cutting, mock experiments using eggs, and including the world's first teleoperated cranial window.
